Teach for America coding exercise

At Teach For America we have a public website that is powered by Drupal, so managing things on a Drupal platform is critical to that part of our work on IT. The activity below is meant to test your knowledge of Drupal, since the position you are interviewing for will require Drupal development knowledge and experience.

    As an Administrator, I would like a Drupal 8 module that grabs JSON content with multiple entries (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts) and creates a new node, with title, and body for each. For one of the JSON objects, add in an appropriate HTML tag(s) such that the title string is bolded. If Drupal 8 is not possible, then Drupal 7 will be ok.

    There should be an admin UI page to start the process, and only Administrators should be able to access the import.

    Features that are “nice-to-haves” (but not mandatory)
        Drush command to do the import
        Batch processing
        Import users (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users)
        If the node already exists, we don't want to reimport it.

    This module does NOT need to work, but should likely be able to do so if it was tweaked to a given environment. Try to adhere to Drupal formatting as much as possible.
